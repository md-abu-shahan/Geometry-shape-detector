# Geometry shape detector 
Our project is simple; we are building a simple “Geometry shape
detector” which is identifying shape such as circle, rectangle,
triangle, straight line and so on. Actually this project working on
supervised data.
First of all, we are import images which are some geometric shape
on many type of drawn and every same shape classifies same class.
Then convert Image to binary image then convert 1D matrix by
using image processing mechanism.
